The data structure that is maintaining the Obj objects is called ConObject. It is used along with ObjectNode 
and ObjectNodeComp to maintain the data structure. ConObjects will be used to store each type of parent and child class 
that is called through inheritance. As each type of parent/child classes constructor is called
it will be inserted into the ConObjects instance as defined by collection. The object node is used to 
store both the class name and the class count. The ObjectNodeComp class is used to compare 
two ConObjects by their count and helps with sorting from greatest to least. In the Parser class a 
ConObjects class is used to store a linked list of Strings. This linked list sorts the strings by their name. 
First we define a linkedlist of type ObjectNode that holds strings. A for loop that will go through the linkedlist 
and get the count of each class type and store it in the ConObjects defined in Obj. This will sort the collection of
ObjectNodes by count. This will write the data such as the object class name and the count of the class occurences.
