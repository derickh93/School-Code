 * Title: 	Lab 0:
 * Filename: 	SieveOfEratosthenes.java
 * Date Written: 	January 23,2017
 * Due Date: January 28, 2017
 * 
 * Description: 
 * Displays prime numbers using The Sieve of Eratosthenes.
 * 
 * The use is permitted to enter a value for n, and then all prime numbers in the range 2 to n are displayed.
 * 
 * Algorithm
 * 
 * We start with a table of numbers (e.g., 2,3,4,5,...,n) and progressively 
 * cross off numbers in the table until the only numbers left are primes.
 * Specifically, we begin with the first number, p, in the table, and
 * 1. Declare p to be prime, then display it
 * 2. Cross off all the multiples of that number in the table, starting from p^2
 * 3. Find the next number in the table after p that is not yet crossed off and
 * set p to that number; and then repeat steps 1 to 3.
