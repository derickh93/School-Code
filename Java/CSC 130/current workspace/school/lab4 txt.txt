1. What are the Card class’ instance variables?
private int value;
private String suit;

2. What discrepancy do you see between your three lines of output and the first three
lines of the expected output? Note: this discrepancy will exist for a while, and that’s
ok. You’ll fix it later.
Instead of getting a Jack of diamonds i get 11 of diamonds.

3. What’s weird about the return values from those three calls to toString? What do
you think should be changed?
The return values are numeric. They should be the names of the Suit.

4. What happens when you compare two String reference variables using the ==
operator?
You get an error because == is used to compare integers. You have to use .equals to compare a string.

5. Which step of the instructions did you have to complete to remove the discrepancy
you wrote about in Question #2?
In the toString method used the card values to give face cards a Name and numeric cards a value.
