Question 1: What is the syntax error message?
-TODO Auto-generated method stub
-Type mismatch: cannot convert from Deck to GUI

Question 2: What do you think this error means?
- The variable declared does not match.

Question 3: What is the syntax error message?
- The method shuffleDeck() is undefined for the type GUI.

Question 4: What do you think this error means?
- The method shuffleDeck() is not defined therefore cannot be used with the variable theWindow because it is declared as a GUI so they do not match.

Question 5: In which class is the shuffleDeck method defined? 
What is the header for this method?
- Deck
- void shuffleDeck()

Question 6: Are there any parameters specified for this method? If so, what is/are
the data type(s) of the parameter(s)?
-There are no parameters.

Question 7: What is the data type of the return value?
-Card

Question 8: Are there any parameters specified for this method? 
If so, what is/are the data type(s) of the parameter(s)?
-no

Question 9: What is the data type of the return value?
-String

Question 10: Run the program. What is displayed in the message pane at the bottom
of the screen?
-13 of clubs

Question 11: What is the syntax error message?
-The method showCard(GUI) is undefined for the type Card

Question 12: What do you think this error means?
-The datatypes do not match since showCard is not defined.

Question 13: Are there any parameters specified for this method? If so, what is/are
the data type(s) of the parameter(s)?
-no

Question 14: What is the data type of the return value?
-Integer

Question 15: Why do we need both a toString method and a getValue method
for this class? Don’t both of them tell us what value the card has?
-The toString method displays the value of the card along with the type as a string. The getValue method displays a single number as a integer.
-They both tell the value but one is an integer attached to a string while the other is a integer by itself.

Question 16: Are there any parameters specified for this method? If so, what is/are
the data type(s) of the parameter(s)?
-no
Question 17: What is the data type of the return value?
-Integer

Question 18: Why do we need both a getValue method and a getPointValue for
this class? What is the difference between the values that get returned? (You
might need to run the program several times to answer this question.)
- The getValue method returns a integer based off the corresponding card. 
-The getPointValue method returns a integer based on the point value of the cards.
-The difference is getValue gives you the number of the card and getPointValue gives you the point value of the card.
