The data structure I used was a template based upon the sample program given. The reason for this is because my project 3 was incomplete.
To implement the inherited functions in the symbol table I created a function called expandFunction. This function works similarly to the
expand function for inherited fields. It checked the super class for functions and included them in the ClassDefEntry for the current class. This method was 
called along with the expand method for fields. Then to map each function name to its parameter list and body expression I created the variable currentBodyListEntry to keep track
of the body of the function. This variable was appended to each time a body object was called during a FunDefList object execution. Once the function definition was fully retrieved 
it was then placed into a hashmap containing function name and body key/pair. I then included the function map hashmap object in the ClassObj so that a pointer to the function table 
for a class existed. The eval method for variable identifier and this expression were implemented to specification. The DotExp eval function was not fully implemented.
