 * <p>Description: This class represents a Hand of playing cards. takes the cards
 * dealt from the deck and enters them consecutively into the array cards 
 * the default is a hand of size 10 but only 7 cards are dealt. also keeps a 
 * count of the number of cards in the hand. makes a copy of the hand which 
 * can be altered. has methods to replace a card in the hand, make a copy of 
 * the hand, search if the hand contains a specific card, find the number
 * of face cards in the hand, find the lowest card in the hand, replace
 * the lowest card in the hand, and to make a string containing a list
 * of all the cards currently in the hand. </p>
